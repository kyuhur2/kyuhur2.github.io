# Kyu Hur's React TypeScript CV

Repository for https://kyuhur2.github.io. Adopted from Kien Dang's React-TypeScript Resume format.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the most recent LTS version)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (the most recent stable version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.

## Development setup

### `yarn install`

Installs the necessary node modules in `./node_modules`.

### `yarn start`

Hosts an interactive site on the localhost.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Also see [this](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) post to learn how to deploy a react app website using github pages.

## Notes

To push changes onto the site, the `./node_modules/.cache/gh-pages` has to be deleted as according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63964575/fatal-a-branch-named-gh-pages-already-exists) post. No discussion as to why this is the case.
